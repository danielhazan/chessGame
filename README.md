# chessGame

daniel.hazan blueshnitzel   This project implements and designs a board-game for a console-based 
chess game between two users. the project uses principles of object-oriented programming , and design 
an appropiriate board for playing.  every pawn in game has unique opportunities for moving and eating 
on board, thus implemented by a unique cpp class which designs its behavior on various cases by checking 
the validity of each move the user decided to play.  the file chess.cpp contains the main method which 
runs the game untill one of the playes win.
